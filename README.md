# SRS-App
Python App created using kivy/kivyMD

School is starting in a few months time in October 2021, it is going to be hectic so time management is of the essence. 
The first step to time management is of course being able to track how much time you spend studying, working, playing and resting. 
There are many time tracking apps out there, offering a myriad of functionalities, which I often find excessive and distracting.

Furthermore, why pay for these apps or suffer looking at ads when you have the time and skills to create one yourself?

With that, I introduce SRS App (it stands for Serious App), an app made by an ad-rebel packed with just the right functionalities you need for proper time management.

Here are its functions:
1. Start-stop timer
2. 4 Categories of activity to choose from 
3. Summary page
4. Link to Google sheets

Technologies used in the App: 
- This app is written in Python and kivy/kivyMD. 
- It uses Google API to link to Google Sheets. 
- It can be packaged using Pyinstaller to create a Desktop App.
